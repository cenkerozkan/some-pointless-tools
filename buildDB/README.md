# About
I'm working on a side project which I'm trying to build a database about movies from scratch.
So I wrote this program to gather informations about movies and save them into a JSON file to import into the database later.

**I am going to upload the whole project as soon as I finish, I may re-upload this program inside of the project.**

**Sample Run:**
