During one of my classes about SDLC, I recognized that my teacher struggling setting the HDMI mode as 'Mirror'
I asked him if he wants a .bat file just to click and manage the HDMI mode and he said yes.

On windows, there is a program called 'DisplaySwitch.exe' under system32 directory, it has four parameters and the second one sets the display as 'mirror' for the HDMI. This file calls the executable with parameter 2, then my teacher does not have to find where the HDMI settings :D
